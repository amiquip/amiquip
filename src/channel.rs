/// Handle for an AMQP channel.
///
/// # Interaction with I/O Thread
///
/// A `Channel` is a wrapper around in-memory channels that communicate with its
/// [connection](struct.Connection.html)'s I/O thread. Messages to the I/O thread go through
/// bounded channels; see the discussion on [connection tuning](struct.Connection.html#tuning) for
/// more details.
///
/// ## Unbounded Memory Usage
///
/// Messages coming from the I/O thread use in-memory channels that are unbounded to prevent a slow
/// or misbehaving channel from blocking the I/O thread. This means it is possible for memory usage
/// to also grow in an unbounded way. There are two ways an unbounded in-memory channel gets
/// created:
///
/// * Creating a consumer; the channel for delivering messages is unbounded.
/// * Attaching a [returned message listener](#method.listen_for_returns); the channel for
/// delivering returned messages is unbounded.
///
/// To control the memory usage of consumers, avoid the use of `no_ack` consumers. If the consumer
/// is set up to acknowledge messages, the server will not send messages until previous messages
/// have been acknowledged, and you can use [`qos`](#method.qos) to control how many outstanding
/// unacknowledged messages are allowed. `no_ack` consumers do provide higher performance, but
/// amiquip does not have a mechanism for avoiding unbounded growth on the consumer channel if the
/// consumer is not processing messages fast enough to keep up with deliveries from the server.
///
/// There is no built-in mechanism to limit memory growth on a channel's returned message listener.
/// If the returned message listener cannot keep up with the rate of returned messages, consider
/// dropping the listener (which will force the I/O thread to discard returned messages instead of
/// buffering them into a channel) and reattaching a new listener once you have caught up.
///
/// ## Connection Errors
///
/// If the connection that opened this channel closes, operations on this channel will fail, and
/// may or may not return meaningful error messages. See the discussion on
/// [`Connection::close`](struct.Connection.html#method.close) for a strategy to deal with this.
